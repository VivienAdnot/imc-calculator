=============

First Android App. Ask weight and size and return the imc number.

### TODO

- check for 0 in Weight and Size
- Send Toasts to the user when an exception is thrown
- Ensure that Log is working
- Add a better separation between MainActivity and IMC Logic
- Add Unit tests for IMC Logic
- Add interpretation of the result (light, good, obese)
